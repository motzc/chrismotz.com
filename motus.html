                <h1>Motus</h1>
                <p>What will the world be like in 5 years? 10 years? 20 years? No one really knows, which is why this is the billion-dollar question. However, while nothing is certain, as designers we can use certain tools to guess what the world may be like in 2038. Future techniques are design methodologies that encourage us to extend the vectors of global progress so that we might envision what kind of world they are heading toward. Motus is design futures project that explores what the world might look like in 2039. Who is living in this world? How do they interact with one another? What are their problems? How do they feel?</p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Design a future artefact, and a future world. This is brief for my first project at the Royal College of Art, Futures. My programme – Global Innovation Design – is purposely ambiguous in some areas because it encourages student to pursue a wide variety of subjects and interests to acquire a more holistic perspective of the world. As such, we are pushed to think globally with all of our project. Futures is an opportunity for us to better understand what the design challenges of the future will be.</p>
                <p>This project was completed with Eva Oosterlaken, Anthony Wu, and Violet Zhuang.</p>
                <h1>Process</h1>
                <p>We began by looking at where certain global progress vectors were heading in 5, 10, and 20 years to get an understanding of what some characteristics of the future world may be. This included explorations technological, political, and economic changes, but also ones to do with human nature. As an example, “How might the nature of relationships and love change in 20 years?” After this, we progressed through a series of design methodologies including ‘How Might We’s’ and 2x2 matrices, ending with 4 personas of characters that we used to define our future world. From these, we wrote our purpose statement:</p>
                <div class="purpose-statement">
                    <h6>In 2038, people will have a harder time expressing their emotions because they…</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>have less human contact</li>
                        <li>have less sense of self, and</li>
                        <li>are accustomed to instant gratification</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h6 class="space-above">Because of this, we aim to design a solution that empowers people to be mentally prepared to <b class="feelings">express</b> their emotions AND to consciously <b class="feelings">digest</b> the emotions of other.</h6>
                </div>
                <h1 class="more-space">Outcome</h1>
                <div class="structure-img">

                </div>
                <p>The artefact we designed was MOTUS, a tool that allows you to translate your emotions into a physical form, giving you a new way to understand your feelings and share them with others. In a world where people are further apart physically and emotionally, MOTUS allows you to create representations of your emotions through interacting with it. You can then share this shape with friends, family, and loved ones who can feel this emotion through their own MOTUS and put in their own touch.</p>
                <p>In renderings, we showed MOTUS to be made of a foam core then covered with smart plastics and a sensor-woven fabric that would allow a user to feel emotions through it. The real-world prototype was made from clear balloons filled with flour. Below are stills from a video illustrating the intended interaction.</p>
