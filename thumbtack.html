                <h1>Thumbtack TV Commercial</h1>
                <p>Have you ever needed to find a landscaper, handyman, or pool cleaner? Oleg did, but luckily he was able to hire all of these professionals on Thumbtack.com, an online marketplace for local service professionals. While working on the marketing team for Thumbtack, I lead the initial production on their first ever TV commercial to feature a real customer. During this process, I met Thumbtack power user Oleg who starred in what is currently Thumbtack’s best performing TV commercial.</p>
                <h6>San Fracisco, CA | August 2017</h6>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Thumbtack is rather unique in the technology startup world in that it dedicates considerable time and resources to TV as one of their main advertising channels. This is because it is still one of the most effective ways to reach their target customers, who are generally middle aged and live in suburban areas. The studio team at Thumbtack has produced a number of successful TV commercials in the past, some of which produced nearly entirely in-house. However, they had not made one featuring real customer testimonials – something that has long been an ambition of theirs – as it is common practice to hire professional actors for these roles.</p>
                <p>The end of my summer at Thumbtack was spent getting production started for their first and only commercial to star a real customer, who ended up being the powerhouse-user, Oleg.</p>
                <h1>Process</h1>
                <p>To get production started, my first responsibility was to recruit the customer that would appear in the commercial. This task comprised of three steps: searching, interviewing, and selecting this customer.</p>
                <p><b>1) Searching:</b> The search for this TV star began by casting a very large net. Working with Thumbtack’s analytics team, I was able to discover who were the top (based on frequency of use) Thumbtack customers in the San Francisco Bay Area. We crafted and sent out an email to these customers advertising this opportunity and enticing them sign up for an interview.</p>
                <p><b>2) Interviewing:</b> 40+ people responded to our initial message expressing interest in appearing in Thumbtack’s upcoming TV commercial. With this list of incredible customers, I began the process of interviewing all of them to determine who would be the most appropriate person for the spot. The interviews were almost entirely conducted over video chat software with a list of standardized questions. That said, the goal of these calls was to get the customers to talk as naturally as possible and hear their Thumbtack stories.</p>
                <p><b>3) Selecting:</b> All interviewees were assessed based on his or her presence, story, and ability to articulate product benefits. Based on these three factors, a group on the studio team and I decided which one of these amazing Thumbtack customers would be best for the spot. I had the pleasure of notifying the future TV star, Oleg.</p>
                <p>With the customer selected, the next task was to craft a narrative for this commercial. Based on Oleg’s experiences with Thumbtack, I worked with designers, producers, and copywriters from Thumbtack’s brand team to figure out the appropriate setting and script for the commercial. Oleg had used Thumbtack for a wide variety of services, so we chose to film the commercial at Oleg’s house to show off the amazing that had been done.</p>
                <h1>Outcome</h1>
                <p>My time at Thumbtack ended the week before the commercial was shot in Sacramento. However, I was thrilled to see the commercial that the studio team at Thumbtack produced, ‘Meet Oleg’, This commercial is the company’s most successful TV spot to date, producing their lowest ever cost per request in broadcasted regions. I feel extremely lucky that I had the opportunity to work on such a fun and rewarding project.</p>
