                <h1>Thumbtack TV Commercial</h1>
                <p>Have you ever needed to find a landscaper, handyman, or pool cleaner? Oleg did, but luckily he was able to hire all of these professionals on Thumbtack.com, an online marketplace for local service professionals. While working on the marketing team for Thumbtack, I lead the initial production on their first ever TV commercial to feature a real customer. During this process, I met Thumbtack power user Oleg who starred in what is currently Thumbtack’s best performing TV commercial.</p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Thumbtack is rather unique in the technology startup world in that it dedicates considerable time and resources to TV as one of their main advertising channels. This is because it is still one of the most effective ways their target customer, who are generally a little bit older and live in suburban areas. The studio team at Thumbtack has produced a number of successful TV commercials in the past, some of which nearly entirely in-house. However, they had not made one featuring real customer testimonials – something that has long been an ambition of theirs – as common practice is to hire professional actors for these roles.</p>
                <p>The end of my summer at Thumbtack was spent getting production started for a commercial starring a real Thumbtack customer, who ended up being the powerhouse-user, Oleg.</p>
